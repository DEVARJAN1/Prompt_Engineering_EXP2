EXP 2: Comparative Analysis of Naïve Prompting
versus Basic Prompting Using ChatGPT Across
Various Test Scenarios
Aim
To evaluate the effectiveness of different prompting techniques (naïve prompting and basic
prompting) when interacting with ChatGPT across a variety of test scenarios. This analysis will
help to understand the impact of prompt engineering on the quality and relevance of ChatGPT's
responses.
Instructions
1. Define Prompting Techniques:
● Naïve Prompting: This involves providing ChatGPT with a simple, direct prompt without any
additional context or instructions. For example, "Write a poem about a cat."
● Basic Prompting: This technique involves providing ChatGPT with a more structured
prompt, including specific instructions, questions, or examples to guide the response. For
example, "Write a poem about a mischievous cat who loves to play with yarn. Use a rhyming
scheme of ABAB."
2. Scenario:
Zero-Shot Prompt:
"Explain what a large language model is."
A large language model is an advanced type of artificial intelligence trained on massive
amounts of text data. It uses machine learning techniques to understand and generate
human-like text. These models can perform tasks like translation, summarization, and question
answering by predicting the next word in a sequence based on context. Examples include GPT
(Generative Pretrained Transformer) models, which can complete sentences, engage in
conversation, and even write essays or code with high accuracy.
One-Shot Prompt:
"Explain what a large language model is. For example, think of it as a tool that can generate
human-like text based on patterns it has learned from huge amounts of data. It's like a machine
that can understand and respond to language by predicting the next word in a sentence. Can
you explain this in more detail?"
Response:A large language model is a type of machine learning model designed to process and generate
text that mimics human language. It works by analyzing large datasets of text from books,
articles, websites, and more to learn the structure and nuances of language. Once trained, the
model can generate coherent sentences by predicting the next word based on the previous
words, making it capable of tasks like answering questions, writing content, or holding a
conversation. GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) models are popular examples of large
language models, and they excel in understanding context and producing accurate, contextually
relevant text.
3. Design Test Scenarios:
● Create a diverse set of test scenarios that cover a range of tasks and topics, such as:
○ Question answering: "What is the capital of Australia?"
○ Creative writing: "Write a short story about a robot who dreams of becoming a chef."
○ Summarization: "Summarize the main points of the article 'The Future of Artificial
Intelligence.'"
○ Translation: "Translate the sentence 'Hello, how are you?' into Spanish."
○ Code generation: "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."
○ Problem-solving: "How can I solve the Rubik's Cube?"
○ Open-ended questions: "What do you think about the future of artificial intelligence?"
○ Contextual understanding: "Based on the following information, what is the most likely
outcome of the situation?"
4. Conduct Experiments:
● For each test scenario, generate a set of prompts using both naïve and basic prompting
techniques.
● Interact with ChatGPT using each prompt and record the responses.
● Evaluate the quality and relevance of the responses based on criteria such as:
○ Accuracy: Does the response provide correct information?
○ Coherence: Is the response well-structured and easy to understand?
○ Relevance: Does the response address the prompt effectively?
○ Creativity: Is the response original and imaginative?
○ Informativeness: Does the response provide valuable insights or information?
○ Bias: Is the response free from bias or prejudice?
○ Factuality: Does the response contain factual errors or inaccuracies?
5. Analyze Results:
● Compare the responses generated using naïve prompting and basic prompting for each testgenerating harmful or misleading content.
6. Refine Prompts and Experiment Further:
● Based on the initial analysis, refine the prompting techniques used and conduct additional
experiments to explore different approaches.
● Consider using more complex prompting techniques, such as role-playing or providing
examples of desired outputs.
● Experiment with different ChatGPT models or parameters to see how they affect the quality
of responses.
Comparison of Naïve Prompting vs. Basic Prompting:
scenario.
● Identify patterns and trends in the effectiveness of each technique.
● Analyze the factors that contribute to the differences in response quality, such as prompt
specificity, clarity, and relevance.
● Consider the impact of prompt engineering on ChatGPT's ability to generate creative,
informative, and accurate responses.
● Evaluate the ethical implications of using ChatGPT for various tasks, such as the potential for
